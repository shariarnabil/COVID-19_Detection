# COVID-19-Detection-System-Using-CNN-Deep-Learning


## 📌 Project Overview
COVID-19 significantly impacted global healthcare, and rapid screening tools became crucial.  
This project consists of two parts:
1. **Deep Learning Model (DeepCovidX)** – A CNN trained to classify chest X-ray scans as **COVID-19 Positive** or **Normal**.  
2. **Web Application (XRayCam)** – A Flask-based app with camera/file upload support to make real-time predictions using the trained model.
